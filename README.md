# The Melee Library

Made with love by D. Bag. (dbag@meleelibrary.com) and Nate
(nate@meleelibrary.com).

#### Content

##### New Links   

We are happy to take suggestions for new links and content. If you find/make something you
believe is worth including, please contact D. Bag. and let him know! Keep in
mind that we aren't able to include everything ever made, though all
suggestions are greatly appreciated!

##### New Sections/Sub-sections

If you have ideas for new sections, awesome! Please contact D. Bag. so you can
figure out how to best integrate it with the existing Library content. We want
to keep the Library organized, so we're avoiding creating too many sections, but
if you feel that a new section is deserved we would love to hear about it!

#### Design/Technical

We are also open to contributions to the design and code through [pull
requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)
to this repo, though if these are
for new features/ideas (i.e. not direct responses to issues), then get in touch
with Nate first to clear them.
